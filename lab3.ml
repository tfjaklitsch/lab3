                    Polymorphism and record types
 *)


(*
Objective:

In this lab, you'll exercise your understanding of polymorphism and
record types. Some of the problems extend those from Lab 2, but we'll
provide the necessary background code from that lab. *)

(*======================================================================
Part 1: Records and tuples

Records and tuples provide two different ways to package together
data. They differ in whether their components are selected by name or
by position, respectively.

Consider a point in Cartesian (x-y) coordinates. A point is specified
by its x and y values, which we'll take to be floats. We can package
these together as a pair (a 2-tuple), as in the following data type
definition: *)

type point_pair = int * int ;;

(* Then, we can add two points (summing their x and y coordinates
separately) with the following function:

    let add_point_pair (p1 : point_pair) (p2 : point_pair) : point_pair =
      let x1, y1 = p1 in
      let x2, y2 = p2 in
      (x1 + x2, y1 + y2) ;;

........................................................................
Exercise 1: 

It might be nicer to deconstruct the points in a single match, rather
than the two separate matches in the two let expressions. Reimplement
`add_point_pair` to use a single pattern match in a single `let`
expression.
......................................................................*)

let add_point_pair (p1 : point_pair) (p2 : point_pair) : point_pair =
  failwith "add_point_pair not impemented" ;;

(* Analogously, we can define a point by using a record to package up
the x and y coordinates. *)

type point_recd = {x : int; y : int} ;;

let r = {x = 1; y = 3};;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 2A: 

Replace the two lines below with a single let expression that extracts 
the x and y coordinate values from `r` into `x1` and `y1`.
......................................................................*)

let x1 = 0;;
let y1 = 0;;
                   
(*......................................................................
Exercise 2B: 

Implement a function `add_point_recd` to add two points of type
`point_recd` and returning a `point_recd` as well.
......................................................................*)

let add_point_recd =
  fun _ -> failwith "add_point_recd not implemented" ;;

(* Recall the dot product from Lab 2. The dot product of two points
`x1, y1` and `x2, y2` is the sum of the products of their x and y
coordinates.

........................................................................
Exercise 3: Write a function `dot_product_pair` to compute the dot
product for points encoded as the `point_pair` type.
......................................................................*)

let dot_product_pair (p1 : point_pair) (p2 : point_pair) : int =
  failwith "dot_product_pair not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 4: Write a function `dot_product_recd` to compute the dot
product for points encoded as the `point_recd` type.
......................................................................*)

let dot_product_recd (p1 : point_recd) (p2 : point_recd) : int =
  failwith "dot_product_recd not implemented" ;;

(* Converting between the pair and record representations of points

You might imagine that the two representations have
different advantages, such that two libraries, say, might use
differing types for points. In that case, we may want to have
functions to convert between the two representations.

........................................................................
Exercise 5: Write a function `point_pair_to_recd` that converts a
`point_pair` to a `point_recd`.
......................................................................*)

let point_pair_to_recd =
  fun _ -> failwith "point_pair_to_recd not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 6: Write a function `point_recd_to_pair` that converts a
`point_recd` to a `point_pair`.
......................................................................*)

let point_recd_to_pair =
  fun _ -> failwith "point_recd_to_pair not implemented" ;;

Part 2: A simple database of records

A college wants to store student records in a simple database,
implemented as a list of individual course enrollments. The enrollments
themselves are implemented as a record type, called `enrollment`, with
`string` fields labeled `name` and `course` and an integer student ID
number labeled `id`. The corresponding type definition might be: *)

type enrollment = { name : string;
                    id : int;
                    course : string } ;;

(* Here's an example of a list of enrollments. *)

let college = 
  [ { name = "Pat";   id = 603858772; course = "cs51" };
    { name = "Pat";   id = 603858772; course = "expos20" };
    { name = "Kim";   id = 482958285; course = "expos20" };
    { name = "Kim";   id = 482958285; course = "cs20" };
    { name = "Sandy"; id = 993855891; course = "ls1b" };
    { name = "Pat";   id = 603858772; course = "ec10b" };
    { name = "Sandy"; id = 993855891; course = "cs51" };
    { name = "Sandy"; id = 482958285; course = "ec10b" }
  ] ;;

(* In the following exercises, you'll want to avail yourself of the
List module functions, writing the requested functions in higher-order
style rather than handling the recursion yourself.

........................................................................
Exercise 7: Define a function called `transcript` that takes an
`enrollment list` and returns a list of all the enrollments for a given
student as specified with the student's ID.

For example: 

    # transcript college 993855891 ;;
    - : enrollment list =
    [{name = "Sandy"; id = 993855891; course = "ls1b"};
     {name = "Sandy"; id = 993855891; course = "cs51"}]
......................................................................*)

let transcript (enrollments : enrollment list)
               (student : int)
             : enrollment list =
  failwith "transcript not implemented" ;;
  
(*......................................................................
Exercise 8: Define a function called `ids` that takes an `enrollment
list` and returns a list of all the ID numbers in that list, eliminating
any duplicates. The `sort_uniq` function from the `List` module may be
useful here.

For example:

    # ids college ;;
    - : int list = [482958285; 603858772; 993855891]
......................................................................*)

let ids (enrollments: enrollment list) : int list =
  failwith "ids not implemented" ;;
  
(*......................................................................
Exercise 9: Define a function `verify` that determines whether all
the entries in an enrollment list for each of the ids appearing in the
list have the same name associated.

For example: 

    # verify college ;;
    - : bool = false
......................................................................*)

let verify (enrollments : enrollment list) : bool =
  failwith "verify not implemented" ;;

(*======================================================================
Part 3: Polymorphism

........................................................................
Exercise 10: In Lab 2, you implemented a function `zip` that takes two
lists and "zips" them together into a list of pairs. Here's a possible
implementation of `zip`:

let rec zip (x : int list) (y : int list) : (int * int) list =
  match x, y with
  | [], [] -> []
  | xhd :: xtl, yhd :: ytl -> (xhd, yhd) :: (zip xtl ytl) ;;

As implemented, this function works only on integer lists. Revise your
solution to operate polymorphically on lists of any type. What is the
type of the result? Did you provide full typing information in the
first line of the definition? (As usual, for the time being, don't
worry about explicitly handling the anomalous case when the two lists
are of different lengths.)
......................................................................*)

let zip =
  fun _ -> failwith "zip not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 11: Partitioning a list -- Given a boolean function, say

    fun x -> x mod 3 = 0

and a list of elements, say, 

    [3; 4; 5; 10; 11; 12; 1]

we can partition the list into two lists, the list of elements
satisfying the boolean function (`[3; 12]`) and the list of elements
that don't (`[4; 5; 10; 11; 1]`).

The library function `List.partition` partitions its list argument in
just this way, returning a pair of lists. Here's an example:

    # List.partition (fun x -> x mod 3 = 0) [3; 4; 5; 10; 11; 12; 1] ;;
    - : int list * int list = ([3; 12], [4; 5; 10; 11; 1])

What is the type of the `partition` function, keeping in mind that it
should be as polymorphic as possible?

Now implement the function yourself (without using `List.partition`,
though other `List` module functions may be useful).
......................................................................*)
   
let partition =
  fun _ -> failwith "partition not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 12: We can think of function application itself as a
higher-order function (!). It takes two arguments -- a function and
its argument -- and returns the value obtained by applying the
function to its argument. In this exercise, you'll write this
function, called "apply". You might use it as in the following examples:

    # apply pred 42 ;;
    - : int = 41
    # apply (fun x -> x ** 2.) 3.14159 ;;
    - : float = 9.86958772809999907

(You may think such a function isn't useful, since we already have an
even more elegant notation for function application, as in

    # pred 42 ;;
    - : int = 41
    # (fun x -> x ** 2.) 3.14159 ;;
    - : float = 9.86958772809999907

But we'll see a quite useful operator that works similarly -- the
backwards application operator -- in Chapter 11 of the textbook.)

Start by thinking about the type of the function. We'll assume it
takes its two arguments curried, that is, one at a time.

What is the most general (polymorphic) type for its first argument
(the function to be applied)?

What is the most general type for its second argument (the argument to
apply it to)?

What is the type of its result?

Given the above, what should the type of the function "apply" be?

Now write the function.
......................................................................*)

let apply =
  fun _ -> failwith "apply not implemented" ;;
